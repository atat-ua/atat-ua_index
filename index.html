				<p>
					<br/>
					I am Victor Adam, the creator of this blog and podcast. Since I can remember, sports have been part of my life. I grew up playing tennis and basketball, and over 
					the years I've explored everything from football and kickboxing to BJJ, climbing, sailing, skiing, snowboarding
					windsurfing, kayaking, downhill...<br/>
					<br/>
					This blog exists because I've always been fascinated not just by practicing sports, but by understanding them. 
					Each article you'll find here is born from that curiosity: wether I've tried the sport myself or interviewed
					athletes, coaches, and sports scientists to answer the questions most people have when they are starting out or
					wanting to go deeper. <br/>
					<br/>
					I created this space for anyone who loves sports or wants to fall in love with any of them but still doesn't know. 
					My goal is to make it a useful resource for athletes, coaches, and anyone who wants tu understand training, injury
					prevention, performance, or simply the joy of moving your body in different ways.<br/>
					<br/>
					I truly believe that integrating a sport into your life is one of the most powerful ways to stay healthy and active 
					in the long run. For those who don't currently practice any sport, engaging to one can make stay active so much more 
					fun and sustainable than only going to the gym. And for those who already train at the gym, having a 
					sport to apply your strength, endurance, and skills can be incredibly motivating - it gives purpose to your training,
					and the satisfaction of improving little by little in a sport you love is hard to beat.<br/> 
					<br/>
					In a world where lot of fitness content is focused on gyms and aesthetics, I believe there’s a place for exploring sports
					in their full depth – tactically, physically, and mentally
					<br/>
					Outside of sports, I am industrial engineer specialised on electronics. I consider myself a curious person who loves 
					meeting people from different backgrounds, I like electronic music and bossa nova, and I like as well walking in nature 
					to reset.<br/>
					<br/>
					Thank you for reading, listening and sharing this journey with me.
