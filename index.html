				<p>
					<br/>
					I am Victor Adam, the creator of this blog and podcast. Since I can remember, sports have been part of my life. I grew up playing tennis and basketball, and over 
					the years I've explored everything from football and kickboxing to climbing, sailing, skiing, snowboarding,
					windsurfing, BJJ, kayaking, downhill...<br/>
					<br/>
					This blog exists because I've always been fascinated not just by practicing sports, but by understanding them. 
					Each article you'll find here is born from that curiosity: wether I've tried the sport myself or interviewed
					athletes, coaches or sports scientists to answer the questions most people have when they are starting out or
					wanting to go deeper in any sport. <br/>
					<br/>
					This space is for anyone who loves sports or feels they might fall in love with them if they find the right one.
					Because here’s something I truly believe: integrating a sport into your life is one of the most powerful and enjoyable 
					ways to stay healthy and active for the long run.<br/>
					<br/>
					If you don’t currently practice any sport, discovering one can make movement fun again – far more sustainable than just
					forcing yourself to go to the gym and hoping to stick with it. 
					For those of you who already train at the gym, including a sport gives your training a great purpose. You’ll find yourself 
					wanting to build strength, endurance, and skills not just for looks, but for better performance regarding the sport you choose.
					Last not but least, if you are already practicing a certain sport, which is not just gym session, I desire you a lot of fun! <br/> 
					<br/>
					In a world where lot of fitness content is focused on gyms and aesthetics, I believe there’s a place for exploring sports
					in their full depth – tactically, physically, and mentally.<br/>
					<br/>
					Outside of sports, I am industrial engineer specialised on electronics. I've always been a curious person who likes learning.
					I like meeting people from different backgrounds, listening to electronic music and bossa nova, and I often walk in nature to
					clear my mind and find inspiration for what comes next.<br/>
					<br/>
					Thank you for reading, listening and sharing this journey with me.
