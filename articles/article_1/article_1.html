    	<p>
      Not long time ago I tried for the first time BJJ, and I have been around
			one year and a half practicing it, until I left the city where my gym was.
			Here is how it went my journey with this great sport.
    	</p>
			
			<h1>
      	Mental and physical skills learnt
			</h1>

    	<p>
      	While practicing BJJ, I have learnt meantal and physical skills
				for this sport and for life.
    	</p>

    	<img src="../../../images/picture/Podcast/podcast_2.jpg" class="inline-image" alt="img_1">

    	<p>
      	From one side, regarding the mental skills, you learn how to keep as calm 
				as possible while someone is trying to choke you or break some bone. This 
				skill let you think clearer how to protect yourself or how to counter-attack 
				your training partner or opponent while being in such critical situation.
    	</p>
			<p>
      	On the other side, regarding the physical part, literally what you learn is to
				hold the pressure of somebody that is over you, how to move your body in order
				to scape from your opponent, even how to breath! Looks like a joke but really, 
				when you are under such stressful situations, to breath properly is a key point. 
    	</p>
			
			<h1>
      	Discipline
			</h1>
			
			<p>
     		Your discipline while practicing Bjj is reinforced because you feel that if you are 
				constant in training, you immprove little by little. And in the moments that you feel
				you are not progressing, your training partners, specially the higher belts makes you 
				realize that is completely normal to have this feeling, but the secret is do not stop 
				and keep moving training after training. 
    	</p>

      	“Repeat, repeat and repeat.” – Onur Yasar
    	</blockquote>

			<h1>
      	Atmosphere
			</h1>
			
			<p>
     		Another thing to highlight of Bjj is the atmosphere. The training partners were so respectful, trying
				to help you in case you felt lost on how to do certain exercise.
    	</p>
    	
			<h1>
      	Enroll your kid/s
			</h1>
			
			<p>
     		In my opinion if I have to enroll to any sport my future kid/s, Bjj probably would be one of my first options
			, because the values and skills that this sport gives you, I find them pretty useful later for life.

      	To close this post
			</h1>

			<p>
      	To close this post, I want to encourage you that in case you want to know more about Bjj, here 
				in the following link you can hear the podcast episode that I had with Onur Yasar, a great Bjj fighter, 
				trainer, father, but above all, great person. We talk a little bit about his background, how he structure
				the trainings, how is competting in Bjj and much more!
